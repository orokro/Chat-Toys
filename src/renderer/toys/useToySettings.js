/*
	useToySettings.js
	-----------------

	Uhh, idk, this is sorta in the 'hook' pattern which this project
	doesn't really use anywhere else, but I felt like it kinda made sense here.

	This is totally an afterthought, especially since I decide that the
	multi-browser-source option in OBS is probably the way to go anyhow.

	Anyway, the purpose here is to let the various widgets call useToySettings
	to automatically get the settings for the toy they are a part of.

	This includes setting up the socket to access the settings.
